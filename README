An implementation of the kmeans algorithm, using kdtrees to
speed up finding nearest centroids. There is both a CPU and
a GPU version (using CUDA). 

Build:
    $make

Run on randomly generated inputs:
    $./kdkmeans
To visualize the clustering for randomly generated inputs, run 
the show.sh script. This uses the temporary files generated by
kdkmeans in /tmp/ and visualizes the clustering.

Parameters (such as size of the problem) to the program can be
changed in common.h
